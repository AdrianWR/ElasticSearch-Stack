# ElasticSearch-Stack
ElasticSearch Stack, running on DO Kubernetes Engine

# Introduction

Running complex systems is, by not an easy length, a complex task, and please forgive me for this free pun.
There's this moment in the life of a developer, when we are sharp on writing loops, data structures, APIs, and we need to take a setp further, and glue a lot of stuff together.
Be it a simple webserver with just a few endpoints, to a streaming data platform built on top of NoSQL databases, managing these setups implies in a lot of overhead on someone.
This way, one might think in improving them observability stack with log and metrics monitoring, or even tracing.
